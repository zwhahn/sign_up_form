# Example Sign Up Form

I built a sign-up form using HTML and CSS as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form#project-solution). The goal was to gain familiarity with HTML form inputs and how to format them properly using the CSS. This website was built to look like the provided example from the Odin Project. There is no backend.

My form:
